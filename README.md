# Personal-vacation-finder
<p>A project in c#, WPF and .NET <br>
This project is a personal vacation finder system. The system has 3 parts: <br>
- Request section: People can insert what they would like to have in their vacation, and the system directs their request to the matching host. <br>
- Host section: Each host can see all of his hosting units (make some actions on it), and all the matching, and booked requests for each unit (and make some actions on it). <br>
- Manager section: The system manager can find all the information in the system (hosts, requests and orders) and make some actions on it.

The manager section password is: whatdoyouwannado <br>
The hosts system password: All the information about the are in the xml in data binary (in PLWPF). But because we didn't want to put real info, the only way that you can also send mail is the one with the id: 001100114 and the password: whatdoyouwannado
