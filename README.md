# Personal-vacation-finder
<p>A project in c#, WPF and .NET <br>
This projet is a personal vaction finder system. The system has 3 parts: <br>
- Request section: People can insert what they would like to have in their vaction, and the system directs their request to the maching host. <br>
- Host section: Each host can see all of his hosting units (make some actions on it), and all the maching, and booked requests for each unit (and make some actions on it). <br>
- Mannager section: The system mannager can find all the information in the system (hosts, requests and ordes) and make some actions on it. <br>

The mannager section password is: whatdoyouwannado <br>
The hosts system password: All the information about the are in the xml in data binary (in PLWPF). But because we did'nt want to put real info, the only whay that you can also send mail is the one with the id: <b>001100114</b> and the password: <b>whatdoyouwannado</b>
