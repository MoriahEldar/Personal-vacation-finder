<p>A project in c#, WPF and .NET <br>
This projet is a sytem, that it's perpous is to fit people the perfect vacation for them. <br>
People can insert what they would like to have in their vaction, and the system directs the maching host to them. <br>
In the system there are also a hosts system, and their hosting units (and there they see if one of their units has a mach, and they can send them an outmatic mail), and a mannager system, where he can find all the information in the system (hosts, requests and ordes) and make some actions.

To get in to the mannager system, the password is: whatdoyouwannado <br>
To get to the hosts system: All the information about the are in the xml in data binary (in PLWPF). But because we did'nt want to put real info, the only whay that you can also send mail is the one with the id: <b>001100114</b> and the password: <b>whatdoyouwannado</b>
